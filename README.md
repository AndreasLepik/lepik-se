A personal website containing a simple start page and a drum machine. 

## DrumBOT

**A drum machine, a work in progress, your new best friend.**

Create a pattern with the boxes and DrumBOT will play it for you.
Since this is just a personal project for learning web stuff and not meant to be a commercial product, no proper testing is used.

It's faster and more fun if you use the keyboard shortcuts:

`NUM 1-8` : 	Focus on a box on the current row. Double click to toggle.

`R + NUM` : 	Switch instrument row.

`T + NUM` : 	Change tempo.

`L` :           Toggle wheter DrumBOT should loop.

`P` : 	        Play/ pause.
